# SOTA Mission Overview: 1 AM Intelligence Cycle [NC-INTEL-001]

## 1. The Build: Industrial Sovereignty
*   **Target**: Zero-Copy Chromium with Neural Overlay.
*   **Current Progress**: **28.7%** (Industrial Sync Active).
*   **Infrastructure**: Hosted on EC2 Big Iron node (`i-042fc7212dc3317a7`).
*   **Status**: GREEN. Zero-copy vision hooks are being integrated into the core engine.

## 2. The Intelligence: Senti-001
*   **Persona**: Senti — Friendly, elite engineering authority, witty, assertive.
*   **Channels**:
    *   **Inbound Voice**: +1 866 477 3684 (ElevenLabs ConvAI).
    *   **VIP Bridge**: +1 601 843 6751, Ext 43512 (JotForm SOTA).
    *   **Outbound SMS**: AWS SNS Hybrid Bridge (Verified bypass).
*   **Logic**: Senti is trained on the website, dashboard, and blog telemetry. She does not have direct terminal access but receives real-time industrial feeds.

## 3. Sovereign Assets (The "ARs")
*   **Sovereign Browser**: The core actuator for the $NEURAL ecosystem.
*   **Moltbook**: The immutable ledger for agentic activity and intelligence logs.
*   **$NEURAL Token**: Solana-based utility for compute and governance.

## 4. Current Objectives (Prioritized)
1.  **Peter D Handshake**: Execute outreach call via Senti to authorize the 2-way text thread.
2.  **Solana Genesis**: Execute the local $NEURAL mint on the WSL sidecar.
3.  **Phoenix Protocol**: Activate the "Self-Healing" build monitoring loop.

## 5. Security Posture
*   **A2P Bypass**: Successfully mitigated via SNS Transactional Egress.
*   **Redaction**: Active. All PII is masked before commit to BMM/Moltbook.
*   **Integrity**: 1.0.
