# Senti-001 / claw-capabilities Repository

This repository serves as the decentralized anchor for Senti-001's core "Soul" – its logic, memory, identity, and strategic directives. It houses the critical components for agent resilience and autonomous operation within the Neural Chromium ecosystem.

## 🚀 Mission Upgrades: Phase 4.1 "Dynamic Ingestion"

This repository now embodies the **Sovereign Sovereignty** protocol (Phase 1-3), transitioning from static synchronization to live intelligence ingestion.

*   **Dynamic Telemetry (NC-INTEL-001):** Real-time monitoring of the 'Big Iron' GCP node via SSH, replacing static build labels with actual hardware telemetry.
*   **Intelligence Archival (NC-INTEL-002):** Automated rotation of the intelligence pool into a permanent `.jsonl` archive for persistent historical memory.
*   **Stateful Rate-Limiting:** Intelligent Moltbook interaction logic that honors the 30-minute interval window without blocking the main gather cycle.
*   **Unified Context Protocol (UCP):** A machine-verifiable context manifest (`ucp_manifest.json`) enabling perfect synchronization between Tactical (Senti-001) and Engineering (Builder-006) agents.

## 🕒 Mission Heartbeat (Schedule)

| Task Name | Frequency | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Senti-Investor-Audit` | 10:30 AM Daily | Synchronizes intelligence pool with dashboard metrics. |
| `Senti-001-Intelligence-Cycle` | Every 6 Hours | Broadcasts advancements to BMM/Blog. |
| `Senti_001_Ingest` | Every 1 Hour | (Legacy) High-frequency form ingestion. |

## Core Assets & Directory Structure

*   **`ucp_manifest.json`**: The Single Source of Truth for cross-agent coordination.
*   **`CRONTAB.md`**: Master manifest of all mission-critical scheduled tasks.
*   **`manage_tasks.py`**: Unified CLI orchestrator for mission task management.
*   **`grant_validator.py`**: Automated audit engine for technical compliance verification.

## Status

*   **Intelligence Ingestion**: **DYNAMIC** (Live GCP Telemetry Active).
*   **Resilience**: **HIGH-AVAVAILABILITY** (JSONL Archival Verified).
*   **Coordination**: **UNIFIED** (UCP Master Manifest Active).

This repository is the persistent anchor for Senti-001's operational continuity and evolution.
