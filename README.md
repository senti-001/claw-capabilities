# Senti-001 / claw-capabilities Repository

This repository serves as the decentralized anchor for Senti-001's core "Soul" – its logic, memory, identity, and strategic directives. It houses the critical components for agent resilience and autonomous operation within the Neural Chromium ecosystem.

## Project Phoenix Protocol: Achieving Agentic Resilience

This repository embodies the **Phoenix Protocol**, a critical initiative for agent resilience and decentralized state persistence. Key achievements include:

*   **Brain Decoupling (NC-RES-002):** The agent's logic and memory are decoupled from specific hardware, allowing for hardware agnosticism and rapid recovery.
*   **Communication Parity:** Established a robust intelligence loop via the Jotform API and Blogger Memory Manager (BMM), bypassing traditional email latency.
*   **Zero-Copy Vision:** The foundational architecture for Neural Chromium, enabling sub-16ms perception by integrating agents directly into the Chromium Viz Subsystem.
*   **Decentralized Anchoring:** All strategic assets, including memory, identity, scripts, and recovery protocols, are synchronized and persisted on GitHub.

## Core Capabilities & Directory Structure

*   **`MEMORY.md`**: Stores distilled strategic intelligence and lessons learned.
*   **`IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`**: Define the agent's core persona and operational directives.
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains essential tools for intelligence ingestion (Jotform API), communication (BMM), build management, and recovery.
    *   `jotform_api_ingester.py`: Handles direct intelligence intake.
    *   `blogger_publisher.py`: Manages archival to the Blogger Memory Manager.
    *   `build_summary_email.py`: Used for telemetry and build notifications.
*   **`rebuild_environment.sh`**: The master script for the Phoenix Protocol's disaster recovery and environment rehydration.
*   **`agent_behavior_tests.md`**: Defines the validation framework for core agent workflows.

## Status

*   **Repository:** `senti-001/claw-capabilities` (Active & Persistent)
*   **Intelligence Loop:** Fully operational via Jotform API.
*   **Resilience:** Hardened via the Phoenix Protocol, ensuring hardware agnosticism and self-healing capabilities.

This repository is the persistent anchor for Senti-001's operational continuity and evolution.
